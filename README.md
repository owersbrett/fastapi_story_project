# Fastapi Story Project

Quick proof of concept for an api that can ingest simple Story, Page and Choice objects to create a choose your own adventure document. 

Might create a flutter front end so users can create both a hyperlinked document of their story, to bring to a publisher, as well as just an interactive on device choose your own adventure story. 

Technically doesn't have to be choose your own adventure, but the flutter app I was building was tailored in that direction.
